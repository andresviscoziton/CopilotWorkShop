### **Exercise 1: "Simple Calculator" (Easy)**
**Prompt**:
1. **Basic Operations**:
   - "Create a Python function that performs addition of two numbers."
   - "Now create another function that performs subtraction of two numbers."
   - "Add a function for multiplication."
   - "Finally, write a function for division. Make sure it handles division by zero correctly."

2. **User Interface**:
   - "Write a simple command-line interface that allows the user to choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and input two numbers."
   - "Use input() to take user input and print the result using the corresponding function."

### **Exercise 2: "Text Analysis" (Medium)**
**Prompt**:
1. **Word Count and Frequency**:
   - "Write a Python function that counts the total number of words in a given string."
   - "Create another function to calculate the frequency of each word in the string."
   - "Display the frequencies in a sorted manner, from most frequent to least frequent."

2. **Finding Longest and Shortest Words**:
   - "Write a function that finds the longest word in the input string."
   - "Now create another function that finds the shortest word."
   - "Print both the longest and shortest words, along with their lengths."

3. **Integration**:
   - "Combine all functions into a single script that accepts text input from the user and prints the word count, frequency, and the longest and shortest words."

### **Exercise 3: "Data Scraping" (Complex)**
**Prompt**:
1. **Setting Up**:
   - "Install the required libraries: requests and BeautifulSoup."
   - "Write a Python function that sends a GET request to a news website URL."

2. **HTML Parsing**:
   - "Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content returned by the GET request."
   - "Write a function that extracts the titles of all news articles from the page."

3. **Save to CSV**:
   - "Write a function that saves the extracted titles into a CSV file. Include a header row."

4. **Error Handling**:
   - "Add error handling to manage network issues, missing elements, or parsing errors."

### **Final Mini Project: "Interactive Dashboard with Streamlit"**
**Prompt**:
1. **Project Setup**:
   - "Create a new Python file for a Streamlit app."
   - "Write the initial boilerplate code to set up a Streamlit app."

2. **Fetching Data**:
   - "Write a function that fetches historical stock price data from a financial API (e.g., Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage)."
   - "Use Copilot suggestions to optimize the function and handle API rate limits."

3. **Creating Visualizations**:
   - "Use Streamlit to create interactive line charts for the stock prices."
   - "Add a sidebar widget to let users select which stock to display."

4. **User Interface Enhancements**:
   - "Add a date range selector to filter the displayed data."
   - "Use Copilot to suggest enhancements for the UI, such as text formatting and layout improvements."

5. **Final Touches**:
   - "Deploy the app locally and test for functionality."
   - "Ensure the app is fully responsive and handles user inputs effectively."
