Word Count and Frequency:

"Write a Python function that counts the total number of words in a given string."
"Create another function to calculate the frequency of each word in the string."
"Display the frequencies in a sorted manner, from most frequent to least frequent."
Finding Longest and Shortest Words:

"Write a function that finds the longest word in the input string."
"Now create another function that finds the shortest word."
"Print both the longest and shortest words, along with their lengths."
