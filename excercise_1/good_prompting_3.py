    # SELECT user_id, user_age, COUNT(user_age) AS count_age
    # FROM users
    # GROUP BY user_age;
    #
    # The above SQL query is correct. It selects the user_id, user_age, and the count of user_age from the users table and groups the result by user_age.
    #
    # The query can be improved by using the COUNT(*) function instead of COUNT(user_age) to count the number of rows in each group. This is because COUNT(*) is more efficient than COUNT(user_age) as it does not need to check for NULL values.
    #
    # Here is the improved query:
    #
    # SELECT user_id, user_age, COUNT(*) AS count_age
    # FROM users
    # GROUP BY user_age;
    #
    # This query will give the same result as the original query but will be more efficient.
